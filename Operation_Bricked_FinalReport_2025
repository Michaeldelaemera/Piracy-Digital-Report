1. INTRODUCTION TO OPERATION BRICKED

Operation Bricked (OP Bricked) is an independent digital operation developed by the digital vigilante Michael de la Emera. 
Its primary objective is the identification, analysis, documentation, and dismantling of a network of groups and individuals 
involved in the unauthorized distribution of software and the illegitimate recreation of online services belonging to Nintendo Co., Ltd.

The operation specifically focuses on the Nintendo Wii ecosystem, gathering technical, visual, and audiovisual evidence that demonstrates the existence of platforms
enabling digital piracy. This activity is primarily conducted through the distribution of WAD files and the impersonation of discontinued official Wii channels.

2. OBJECTIVES OF THE OPERATION

2.1 General Objective
To conduct a comprehensive investigation into the unauthorized distribution of software and the illegitimate recreation of online services within the Nintendo Wii 
ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of documenting, exposing, and dismantling the digital structures that sustain these activities.

2.2 Specific Objectives
- Identification of platforms, groups, and individuals involved in Wii-related digital piracy.
- Collection of technical, visual, and audiovisual evidence demonstrating the existence of infringing activities.
- Analysis of methods used to distribute WAD files and recreate discontinued official services.
- Documentation of findings in a structured format suitable for technical and legal review.
- Exposure of the impact these illicit activities have on Nintendo’s intellectual property rights and the Wii ecosystem.

3. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

3.1 Scope of the Operation
Operation Bricked focuses exclusively on the Nintendo Wii ecosystem, with particular emphasis on:
- Unauthorized distribution of WAD files, used to install pirated software and channels.
- Illegitimate recreation of discontinued official online services, impersonating Nintendo’s proprietary platforms.
- Platforms, groups, and individuals engaged in facilitating or distributing such content.

The operation does not target casual users but rather aims at identifying and exposing organized efforts that directly 
contribute to the proliferation of piracy-related infrastructures.

3.2 Methodology

The investigation was conducted using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques and strictly legal, publicly accessible sources. The methodology included:
- Technical reconnaissance of forums, repositories, and platforms dedicated to Wii-related content.
- Comparative analysis between legitimate Nintendo services and their illegitimate recreations.
- Archival of data in a structured repository for traceability and long-term reference.
- Cross-verification of findings to ensure accuracy and avoid reliance on unconfirmed sources.

3.3 Domain Intelligence (WHOIS)

As part of the OSINT methodology, WHOIS lookups were performed on domains identified during the investigation.
These lookups allowed the extraction of:
- Domain registration details (registrar, creation and update dates).
- Registrant information (organization, country, anonymization services).
- Technical infrastructure (nameservers, hosting providers).
The WHOIS analysis proved useful in:
- Attributing responsibility to specific operators or organizations.
- Detecting the use of privacy-shielding services to obscure identity.
- Establishing chronology of domain activity in relation to piracy-related incidents.

4.1.4 WiiLink 24 Patcher

Subject of Analysis: WiiLink 24 Patcher
Nature: Unauthorized software patching and installation tool
Entity Responsible: WiiLink Development Team

General Description
The so-called WiiLink 24 Patcher is a program developed and publicly distributed by the WiiLink team to automate the installation of their unauthorized online service.
The group itself describes the tool as one that allows the user to “sit back and relax while the patcher does everything for you”,
confirming the process of automated piracy and Nintendo service impersonation.

Declared Technical Functionality
- Library Utilized: libWiiSharp, specifically designed to manipulate and download official Nintendo Wii channel contents.
- Binary Modification Method: Applies VCDiff (binary diff tool) to alter original Nintendo files.
- Result: Generates patched WAD files, which can then be installed on the Wii console.
- Purpose: These patched WADs are essential to access the WiiLink24 network, which operates as an unauthorized replacement of Nintendo’s original online channels.

Preliminary Findings
The WiiLink 24 Patcher constitutes clear evidence of:
- Download, alteration, and redistribution of Nintendo-owned digital contents.
- Creation of illegitimate derivative works (patched WADs).
- Facilitation of piracy through a simplified and automated process, significantly lowering the technical barrier for end users.

Technical Evidence: Update Log Extracts
- Localization Support Added: Languages supported: English, Italian, Dutch, Hungarian, Japanese. 
Indicates unauthorized translation and redistribution of Nintendo content in patched WAD format.

- Migrated to .NET 9: Documented intent to reduce antivirus false positives.
Confirming an effort to disguise the suspicious nature of the software and circumvent security systems.

- Windows ARM64 Compatibility: Evidence of deliberate expansion of distribution to new platforms, thus facilitating wider propagation of illegal software.

- Patched Wii Speak Channel for Wiimmfi: Direct proof of impersonation of an official Nintendo channel-
Wii Speak and reactivation of its online functionality through unlicensed servers.

- Configuration Flow Reworked (System Channel Restorer): Tool designed to restore and reinstall system-level Nintendo channels, demonstrating deep firmware manipulation.

- Structured Distribution of WADs: Patched files and applications systematically organized in the /WiiLink subdirectory, 
evidencing intentional large-scale distribution of illegitimate packages.

Bug Fixes Documented
1.Crash issues with extra/custom configurations resolved.
2.Photo Channel 1.1 WAD repaired (TMD correctly patched).
3.Confirms the WiiLink team not only distributes.
But also maintains and repairs official Nintendo channels, effectively assuming corporate-level responsibilities without authorization.

4.1.5 List of Patched WADS
The following WAD files were identified as patched and redistributed by the WiiLink project.
These files correspond to modified versions of original Nintendo Wii channels and services:

1.Kirby TV Channel (WiiLink).wad
2.Food Channel (Standard) [English] (WiiLink).wad
3.Photo Prints Channel [English] (WiiLink).wad
4.Wii Room [Spanish] (WiiLink).wad
5.Mii Contest Channel [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
6.Region Select [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
7.Everybody Votes Channel [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
8.News Channel [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
9.Forecast Channel [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
10.Nintendo Channel [PAL] (WiiLink).wad
11.WiiLink Address Settings.wad

Notes:
- Each patched WAD constitutes a derivative work of Nintendo intellectual property.  
- Their redistribution under the WiiLink service demonstrates direct infringement of copyright law.  
- The automation of the patching process lowers the technical barrier, making piracy easily accessible to non-technical users.  
Source: Extracted from WiiLink24 Patcher.exe in a controlled testing environment, for investigative and reporting purposes only.

4.1.5 PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION 

Nature of the Activity
The investigation confirms that WiiLink constitutes an organized network of individuals engaged in the unauthorized reactivation, modification, and distribution
Of official Nintendo Wii software and online services.

- The use of the WiiLink Patcher demonstrates a fully automated mechanism designed to download, alter, and redistribute official Nintendo channels in WAD format.
- These modified WADs impersonate legitimate Nintendo services discontinued in 2019, thus facilitating the continued execution of proprietary content without authorization.

Internal Organization
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence shows that WiiLink is not an informal or anonymous project but rather a structured operation with defined hierarchies.
And identifiable roles including development, content direction, and social media management.

- The presence of public-facing representatives further validates that WiiLink is deliberate and coordinated.
Operating as a sustained collective rather than as isolated fan activity.

Impact on Nintendo

1.Economic: Indirect loss of revenue opportunities, undermining Nintendo’s control over the distribution of its proprietary software.
2.Brand: Unauthorized channels are distributed and presented under the “Nintendo” name, creating consumer confusion and damaging corporate reputation.
3.Legal: International distribution of altered WAD files and impersonated services across multiple jurisdictions.
Significantly amplifying the scope and complexity of the infringement.

Comparative Analysis with Case 1 (Wiishopchannel.net)
The WiiLink case mirrors the operational pattern observed in Case 1 – Nathan Boehm / Wiishopchannel.net. 
Both entities operate under the narrative of “preservation” but in practice execute illicit distribution and reactivation of Nintendo’s intellectual property.

- The recurrence of these activities across separate groups suggests the existence of a wider pattern of coordinated IP violations.

4.1.6 FINAL ASSESSMENT - CASE WIILINK

Summary of Findings

The investigation into the WiiLink network confirms the existence of a structured and coordinated operation engaged in the unauthorized reactivation.
Modification, and redistribution of Nintendo Wii software and services.

- The WiiLink Patcher serves as a central evidence point, providing an automated mechanism for altering and installing proprietary channels.
WADS originally owned by Nintendo.
- The distribution of these patched files enables users to access services discontinued in 2019.
Directly infringing upon Nintendo’s intellectual property and circumventing the company’s authority over its own platforms.

Legal Relevance

1.Infringement of Intellectual Property: Unauthorized duplication, modification, and redistribution of Nintendo’s official channels.
2.Trademark Misrepresentation: Continued use of Nintendo branding through modified channels induces user confusion, falsely suggesting official affiliation.
3.Circumvention of Technological Protection Measures: Use of third-party patchers and tools.
LibWiiSharp, VCDiff, demonstrates deliberate intent to bypass Nintendo’s security frameworks.
4.International Jurisdiction: The WiiLink operation spans multiple territories, complicating enforcement.
But also expanding liability under international copyright and trademark conventions.

Organizational Structure

Evidence collected shows that WiiLink is not an anonymous or sporadic fan effort but a collective with identified leadership and operational hierarchy.
Key individuals, such as the Content Co-Director.
And other named developers, demonstrate accountability within the group, removing any pretense of incidental or uncoordinated activity.

Impact on Nintendo

1.Financial: Loss of indirect revenue opportunities and undermining of Nintendo’s digital distribution strategy.
2.Reputational: Unauthorized revival of discontinued services risks damaging Nintendo’s control over.
Its own historical legacy and creates user confusion regarding official support.
3.Legal Exposure: By offering download links, patching tools, and Discord-based user support, WiiLink exposes itself to multiple counts of copyright infringement.
DMCA violations, and possible CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) implications in the U.S.

Comparative Context

When analyzed in parallel with Case 1 (Wiishopchannel.net), WiiLink demonstrates escalation in scope and sophistication:
- Case 1 involved a single individual replicating a storefront.
- Case 2 represents a coordinated collective, distributing automated patching tools, hosting official-looking channels, and maintaining ongoing user support infrastructure.
This escalation suggests the presence of a growing network of preservationist-piracy hybrids.
Operating under the guise of community service but engaging in systematic IP violations.

Final Determination

The WiiLink operation should be considered a high-priority infringement case. The combination of:
- Identifiable leadership.
- Evidence of deliberate circumvention
- And organized international distribution

Provides Nintendo with strong grounds to pursue legal action, takedown orders, and potential damages claims.

Recommendation

It is recommended that Nintendo Legal:

1.Issue formal cease-and-desist communications to identified members of WiiLink.
2.Pursue DMCA takedowns against GitHub repositories, Discord servers, and web domains directly tied to the operation.
3.Consider civil action for damages, given the organized and sustained nature of the infringement.
4.Expand monitoring for related networks that may operate in tandem with WiiLink, as evidenced by parallels with Case 1.

Analysis:
The presence of Nathan Boehm in both Case #1 (as owner) and Case #3 (as contributor) confirms a direct operational link between at least two projects.
This establishes that the three groups investigated are not fully independent. 
But rather form part of a loosely connected network of individuals cooperating across different initiatives.

Nintendo’s intellectual property is being targeted by a coordinated community with shared contributors and overlapping technical practices.
This pattern strengthens the case for a broader legal strategy, treating the incidents not as isolated infringements.
But as elements of a structured network of piracy and unauthorized service emulation.

4.2.2 About WiiMart

Content Overview:
The WiiMart platform provides direct access to a catalog of unauthorized software packages replicating the former Wii Shop Channel. 
This catalog includes both WiiWare titles and Virtual Console games originally distributed and owned by Nintendo and third-party partners.

WiiWare Titles Identified:
1.Dr. Mario Online Rx
2.My Pokémon Ranch
3.Super Mario 64 (WiiWare variant / emulated release)
4.Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I
5.Fishie Fishie

Virtual Console Titles Identified:
1.Super Mario Bros.
2.Sonic the Hedgehog
3.Super Mario 64
4.Pac-Man
5.Galaga

Preliminary Assessment

The inclusion of these titles demonstrates:
1.Unauthorized redistribution of copyrighted games previously available through Nintendo’s official platform.
2.Cross-licensing violations involving third-party publishers (e.g., Sega with Sonic the Hedgehog, Namco with Pac-Man and Galaga).
3.Replication of Nintendo’s business model, by offering the same titles in an alternative platform controlled by non-affiliated individuals.

This constitutes clear evidence of intellectual property infringement on multiple levels, directly affecting Nintendo and associated rightsholders.

Custom Virtual Console Injects:
In addition to redistributing original WiiWare and Virtual Console titles, WiiMart expands its catalog through the use of custom Virtual Console injects.
These injects are modified ROMs placed into official Nintendo emulator containers (WAD format).
Allowing titles never released on the Wii Shop Channel to be executed as if they were legitimate.

Examples of Recent Injected Titles:
- The New Tetris
- EarthBound
- Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World
- Mortal Kombat

Release Practices:
· WiiMart implements a recurring distribution model branded as “WiiMart Wednesday”, whereby new titles are added weekly.
· Users are directed to consult an “in-progress WiiMart Title Sheet,” further illustrating the systematic and organized nature of the operation.

Preliminary Assessment:

The addition of custom Virtual Console injects demonstrates:
- Unauthorized derivative works – repackaging software never officially distributed on Wii.
- Circumvention of technical protections by using Nintendo’s proprietary emulation framework for non-licensed games.
- Ongoing and structured content distribution, reinforcing that WiiMart functions not as a casual preservation effort but as a sustained piracy network.

Frequently Asked Questions (Evidence Extract)
The following FAQ entries were extracted directly from WiiMart’s public-facing materials. 
They provide insight into the operational model, scope, and self-portrayal of the service.

Troubleshooting & Support

1.Users encountering error codes are instructed to use a proprietary tool or seek direct assistance via Discord or Reddit.
2.Demonstrates existence of a structured support network around the unauthorized service.

Monetization & Wii Points

1.WiiMart explicitly states that its service is “entirely free of charge.”
2.“Wii Points” are simulated solely for cosmetic purposes to mimic the original Wii Shop Channel.
3.Confirms deliberate replication of Nintendo’s monetization system without legal or financial backing.

Compatibility

1.WiiMart can function on the Dolphin Emulator, provided the user has access to a real console NAND.
2.However, download functionality is reported as non-operational under Dolphin.
3.Evidence that WiiMart directly engages with both emulated and physical environments.

Features in Use

1.Developers state that “most of the channel’s features” (downloads, dynamic banners, catalogs) are already functional.
2.Confirms operational parity with the original Wii Shop Channel.

Feature Roadmap

1.Updates are declared to occur “on the owner and developers’ own time.”
2.Gift functionality is explicitly disabled after a request from a WiiConnect24 revival team.
3.Shows interaction with, and possible pressure from, other unauthorized service operators.

Data Storage

1.WiiMart acknowledges that its web server logs IP addresses of connected users.
2.Wii console serial numbers are also stored in a SOAP database, albeit “with encryption.”
3.Confirms collection and processing of personal data by a non-legitimate operator, raising privacy and legal implications.

Common Errors

1.Users experiencing region or black screen errors are instructed to install Priiloader and enable “Region Free EVERYTHING” hacks.
2.Evidence of direct encouragement to bypass Nintendo’s built-in region-lock protections.

Observation
During the investigation of WiiMart, references were identified to a parallel project named “DSiMart”, described by the team as a planned DSi Shop revival.

- Nature of Project: Like WiiMart, DSiMart is conceived as an open-source replacement service for the discontinued Nintendo DSi Shop.
- Status: At present, development is paused, with the group prioritizing efforts on WiiMart.
- Relevance: The existence of DSiMart demonstrates the expansion strategy of the same individuals or associated network.
Aiming to systematically revive and replace multiple defunct Nintendo services.
- Implication: This strengthens the evidence that WiiMart is not an isolated project, but part of a larger coordinated ecosystem attempting to restore, modify.
And redistribute Nintendo’s proprietary platforms without authorization.

4.2.3 FORENSIC NOTE – Branding Similarity

Source Reference: Wal-Mart Logos 1980s–1990s Typeface

Observation
The WiiMart project makes explicit use of branding elements that directly imitate the Wal-Mart corporate identity.
The selected font and visual style correspond to a reproduction of the Wal-Mart logos from the 1980s and 1990s, available in open font repositories.

Forensic Relevance
- This establishes that the project appropriates not only Nintendo’s intellectual property (software, services, channels), but also Wal-Mart’s trademarked branding identity.
- The use of the name “WiiMart” combined with Wal-Mart’s typography and branding aesthetic constitutes a dual infringement:
  1.Copyright / Trademark violation of Nintendo, by cloning the Wii Shop Channel.
  2.Trademark dilution and misappropriation of Wal-Mart’s corporate brand, suggesting endorsement or affiliation that does not exist.
  3.This evidence confirms that WiiMart deliberately seeks to evoke two protected brands simultaneously.
  4.Nintendo + WalMart to reinforce its identity and attract user recognition.

Conclusion
The use of the Wal-Mart logo typeface represents forensic evidence of intentional brand exploitation.
Adding another legal risk vector to the operation of WiiMart, and further substantiating the case of organized infringement.

5.CONCLUDING STATEMENT

Following the comprehensive investigation into the three case files (OB-2025-001, OB-2025-002, OB-2025-003), the following conclusions are established:

5.1 General Findings

1.The subjects under investigation (WiishopChannel.net, WiiLink, WiiMart) operate as organized and structured networks, not isolated fan efforts.
2.Each project demonstrates clear evidence of unauthorized distribution, modification, and reactivation of Nintendo’s proprietary software and services.
3.Activities are coordinated via public-facing websites, Discord servers, GitHub repositories, and social media, confirming a sustained and visible organizational presence.

5.2 Legal Impact

1.Nintendo’s Intellectual Property: All three projects engage.
In the alteration, redistribution, and emulation of Wii Channels and services, violating copyright law and Nintendo’s exclusive distribution rights.
2.Trademark Misuse: WiiMart in particular demonstrates a dual infringement by appropriating both Nintendo’s software and Wal-Mart’s corporate branding.
3.Facilitation of Piracy: Tools such as the WiiLink Patcher automate the process of bypassing Nintendo’s security, lowering the technical barrier for illicit use.

5.3 Networked Operation

1.Despite presenting themselves as independent communities, there is clear overlap of contributors and technical references across the three cases.
2.The recurring involvement of individuals such as Nathan Boehm (WiishopChannel.net, contributor to WiiMart) demonstrates the existence of a connected underground network.

5.4 Forensic Significance

1.Visual evidence (screenshots, WAD directories, emulator tests) confirms the operational functionality of the services.
2.OSINT sources (GitHub, Discord, Bluesky, YouTube, project websites) identify named individuals and roles, establishing accountability.
3.Forensic branding evidence links WiiMart to Wal-Mart’s corporate identity, broadening the scope of infringement beyond Nintendo.

FINAL ASSESSMENT
The activities documented across Cases 1, 2, and 3 constitute a systematic infringement operation targeting Nintendo’s defunct online infrastructure. 
The deliberate organization, technical sophistication, and cross-case collaboration elevate these actions beyond casual fan preservation.
Instead presenting them as an illicit, international-scale reproduction network.

RECOMENDATION
The gathered evidence substantiates sufficient cause for Nintendo (and potentially Wal-Mart, in Case 3) to pursue civil litigation and takedown measures.
With further escalation possible under criminal frameworks depending on jurisdiction.
